Python:
	- Fully train model
	- Improve model
	- Make fully trained model compatible with JS
	- Write poem using multiple keywords
	- NLP?
Website back-end:
	- Combine servers into one Node server (i.e. remove Flask)
	- Model predictions in JS instead of calling Python script using JS compatible model
	- Website no longer relies on Python (Python is only used for model training, not predictions)
